# Modern React Application

A production-ready React application built with modern tools and best practices, featuring authentication, protected routes, and a clean component architecture.

## Technologies Used

- **React 18** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript** - Static type checking for enhanced development experience
- **Vite** - Next-generation frontend tooling for faster development
- **React Router** - Client-side routing for single-page applications
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful, customizable icons
- **ESLint** - Code linting for maintaining code quality
- **Context API** - State management for authentication (we'll try to replace that with Redux)

## Project Overview

This application provides a solid foundation for building modern web applications with React. It includes:

- Authentication system with protected routes
- Responsive layouts optimized for all devices
- Reusable UI components
- Form validation
- Clean project structure
- TypeScript integration
